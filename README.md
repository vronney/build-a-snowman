# Build A Snowman LinkedIn Project

Built project with events that enable to the user to drag and drop items.
User able to use on iPad or any touch enabled device.  

## Used Adobe Illustrator to build items

Used SVG files for the graphics.
Each image is given its own id tag.

## Worked with compatibility issues on different browsers

## Utilized regular events and touch events

## Reset elements layering positions

Items were assigned a z-index of 5 initially.
Once the item is dragged the z-index changes from 5 to 10 allowing the items to be placed on top of each other.
This was done with the resetZ().
